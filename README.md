# html-practice
turns out HTML is also important, well guess i'll have to learn it. i'll make a crude beginners html document for my robot arm project.
youtube.html is the main project, it has all the goodies, the css is in the styles folder. 
i asked chatGPT to write the documentation for the youtube.html code. this is what it did:

This code is an HTML file that contains the code for a clone of the YouTube website's home page. The code includes the following:

-A DOCTYPE declaration that specifies the HTML version of the file.
-An html element that contains the entire document.
-A head element that contains the metadata for the document, such as the character set, viewport, title of the page, and links to various stylesheets used in the page.
-A body element that contains the visible content of the page.
-A header element that contains the navigation bar at the top of the page, which includes the YouTube logo, a search bar, and icons for creating and viewing notifications     and the user's profile.
-A nav element that contains the sidebar navigation links for the homepage, including links for the Home, Explore, Subscriptions, and Library pages.
-A main element that contains the video grid section of the page. The video grid displays a series of video previews with information about the videos, including the video   thumbnail, the video title, the name of the video creator, the number of views, and the video duration.
-The video previews themselves are constructed with various div and img elements and are styled using CSS classes defined in separate CSS files.
-The code is generally well-structured and easy to read, with descriptive class names that make it clear what each element represents. The code also makes use of semantic     HTML tags, which makes it more accessible and easier to understand for both humans and machines. Overall, this is a well-written and well-structured HTML file for a         YouTube clone homepage.
