    <h3>1) Robot shield.</h3>
    <p>
      I am making my own robot shield from scratch, which has proven to be quite
      the challenge. I designed a two layer board in <b>KICAD</b>. I took my
      time and decided to make the board a six axis shield, since it is pretty
      difficult and quite expensive to find, plus I wanted the challenge. After
      the design process was finished, I looked for a proper place to order the
      board, got pretty excited, then <strong>boom!!!</strong>â€¦. Was too
      expensive to ship. So I decided to use my other set of skills to start
      soldering the needed components on a prototyping board, and it came out
      pretty well, so I finished it. Not tested it yet, I do not have the
      stepper drivers or the stepper motors.
    </p>

    <h3>2) Robot arm body</h3>
    <p>
      At first I made the body 3d printable and I felt very, very accomplished I
      had designed a good 5 axis robot arm that could be 3d printed. This
      feeling was sweet, but it did not last long. See, I have access to a 3d
      printer in school, but here is the catch, i will have to buy my own
      filament. Filament in Kenya is <b>fucking EXPENSIVE!!!!</b> Like one spool
      costs like the cost of the current robot arm. So the new robot arm is
      much, much cheaper. It is made using acrylic since I also have access to a
      laser cutter in school. The gearbox is also made using acrylic, and I
      know, I know, it is not a good material for gearboxes. But, it is the
      cheapest and I am not too rich. I have designed the robot in
      <b>Fusion 360</b> then the <b>DXF </b>files in <b>autocad</b>. I have had
      to do tons of research especially in the bearing sector, since it directly
      affects the payload capability of the robot arm.
    </p>

    <h3>3) Electronics.</h3>
    <p>
      I will be using the nema-17 stepper motors to provide the motion for the
      robot arm, and to control them, I chose the <b>A4988</b> stepper drivers,
      again because of their cost. To control those, I will be using the mighty
      <b>ESP32 DEVKIT C</b>. I chose this board because It has inbuilt WIFI and
      Bluetooth, and that I can code with it in micropython and Arduino. The
      whole board is powered using 12 Volts, then the control board is powered
      using 5 Volts, which is obtained by using the <b>L7805</b> voltage
      regulator. The rest of the electronics are just a bunch of capacitors
      resistors, a barrel jack for power, LED and female and male connectors
    </p>
    <h5>COMPONENTS :</h5>
    <ul>
      <li>stepper drivers</li>
      <li>ESP32 DEVKIT C</li>
      <li>L7805 voltage regulator</li>
      <li>LED and resistors</li>
      <li>female and male connectors</li>
      <li>100uf capacitors</li>
      <li>barrel jack</li>
      <li>JST connectors</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>conclusion</h3>
    <p>
      I still want to order the pcb, but i have decided to redesign the whole
      board from scratch again in order to make it smaller. The components will
      still be the same, it will only be sa design change to improve on
      functionality. i dont know how cost saving this will end up being.
